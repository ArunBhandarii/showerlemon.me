### If you make making sense of your core value on a fundamental level, that is what you desire.

The main concept of this article is straightforward, but additional information can help you fully grasp it. As you grow up, the ideas and concepts that shape your identity are largely a result of social conditioning. What motivates and drives you is often subconscious and can be influenced by your upbringing. As organisms, we have a natural desire to thrive and survive, and this requires us to manifest ourselves in different ways. In the past, being part of a tribe was critical to survival, so our biology and DNA were hardwired to prioritize group acceptance. However, as our society has evolved, it has become less important to be part of a tribe for survival. Despite this, some people still feel a strong desire to fit in or impress others, which is rooted in our evolutionary past. Our emotions and desires are all explainable, and even the most dysfunctional fixations have a reason behind them. Fear is a significant part of our core drives, and our ability to deal with it has helped us adapt to reality and grow as a species. As humans, we have a unique ability to create concepts and ideas, which has allowed us to overcome our fears and better understand the world around us.

The concepts and ideas that define who we are often stem from social conditioning, as we learn what drives us and what we desire on both conscious and subconscious levels as we grow up. Human beings, like all organisms, strive to thrive, which requires survival. Survival is hardwired into our DNA and passed down from generation to generation, and it was especially important to be part of a tribe 500 years ago or less, when group membership was essential for survival. Being rejected by a group meant certain death, so it was vital to fit in, gain authority or power, and potentially become a leader.

Similar dynamics are observed in many animal pack mentalities, and understanding them is crucial to overcoming them. The information being conveyed here is fundamental to understanding why people strive to fit in or impress others, and how these desires translate subconsciously into a desire to be part of a bigger group or family. Our core mechanics, such as fear, warmth, and the drive to fit in, are all part of our ability to adapt to reality and grow as a species. As humans became more self-aware, and conscious, and developed advanced concepts and ideas, we began to think critically about our emotions and why they arise.

Even our most dysfunctional fixations can be explained by our upbringing and experiences. Fear is a critical component of survival, and learning how to cope with it is essential for thriving. Overcoming fear requires an understanding of its causes, and creating concepts to explain natural phenomena, such as religion or spirituality, has been a way to cope with existential fear throughout history. By understanding why we feel fear, we can override it and direct it towards a constructive end. Ultimately, understanding these dynamics is essential to understanding ourselves and our place in the world.

If you don't understand the reason why something exists, you may try to find another concept to help you process the emotions that arise from fear, social conditioning, love, or any other source. However, this coping mechanism is flawed because it stems from our primitive origins as humans. We lacked the knowledge to understand the existential fears we experienced and the fast-paced technological advancements that transformed our lives. Even now, our understanding of the world remains limited, and we are conditioned by the knowledge we are exposed to. Over the past hundred years, as science became more integral to our thinking, we experienced exponential growth in our understanding of the world. However, most people are still not aware of the larger picture or their place in it. This lack of awareness is due to the fact that these concepts are not part of our neural network.

This article aims to shed light on where our fears come from, why we feel the way we do, and how understanding these fears can help us overcome them. By understanding the reasons for our fears, we can begin to dismantle the dysfunctional beliefs or constructs we have adopted to cope with them.

The second part delves into the workings of the brain. However, in order to fully comprehend this information, it is necessary to view ourselves as a third person. If we are too caught up in our beliefs and worldview, we will be unable to process the information effectively. In order to fully comprehend the concepts discussed in the article, it is important to maintain an active awareness and engage in healthy habits like working out and eating well.

While it may be easy to identify with anxieties related to fitting in or other surface-level concerns, understanding the processes of the brain requires a deeper understanding that stems from the more advanced parts of our brain. If we remain caught up in the more primitive, impulsive parts of our brain, we will be unable to fully comprehend these concepts.

### Dissecting the Human Brain

I will explain how the brain works, but if you tend to act impulsively, it means that the more advanced parts of your brain may not be active. These advanced parts allow you to reflect on your behavior and course-correct any neural pathways or connections that have been connected wrongly. To do this, you need to view your thought processes from an outsider's perspective. This ability is typically acquired as you grow older, usually around the ages of 12 to 14. If you are quite young, it may be challenging to understand what I am saying because the ability to view yourself from an outsider's perspective develops as your brain matures. Now, let's talk about how humans have evolved. As we evolved from single-cell organisms to human beings, our brains have also undergone significant changes. The brainstem and more primitive parts of the brain developed first, and then the more advanced parts, such as the prefrontal cortex, followed. These advanced parts allow us to process language and reason.

The more primitive parts of the brain, where feelings and fears reside, are also where our subconsciousness resides. While our subconsciousness is just as much a part of us as our consciousness, it does not have the advanced parts necessary to think in speech. Instead, it expresses itself more through feelings and fears. The prefrontal cortex can impact these feelings and fears, as it has the ability to control our emotions to a certain extent.

> For example, if someone points a gun at you, you may experience a lot of fear subconsciously. However, the moment you realize that it's just a toy, your prefrontal cortex can communicate with the more primitive parts of the brain to nullify the fear. It's important to understand the cause of your subconscious feelings in order to control them effectively.

Understanding the causes of our emotions is a process that involves the more primitive part of our brain, which experiences emotions, and the more advanced prefrontal cortex, which analyzes and contextualizes them. However, since we are not born with an innate understanding of this process, it is only through the study of neuroscience that we can gain insight into it.

Emotions are first experienced and then contextualized, making it difficult to understand where they come from. But being able to identify and address the causes of our emotions is crucial for mental and emotional wellbeing. This process takes mindfulness and psychological work, and it's important to be able to understand where our emotions come from in order to address them effectively.

The lack of instinct or programming regarding this process means that it's only through scientific study that we can truly comprehend it. Only recently have we been able to make significant paradigm shifts in our understanding of ourselves and our emotions, thanks to advances in neuroscience.

Understanding the sequence of how our emotions work and how our brains contextualize them can help us build a better relationship with our core selves. This can help us avoid dysfunctional beliefs and suppressive tendencies, allowing us to let our emotions flow more naturally and process them more effectively.

It's important to note that the more advanced parts of our brain are only able to function effectively when our bodies are in good physical condition. Eating healthily and staying active is therefore crucial for both physical and mental health.

As we grow up and gain a better understanding of our emotions and where they come from, we become more aligned with reality. This alignment allows us to label our emotions more effectively, understand them better, and ultimately find relief from the tension and stress they can cause.

At times, you may wonder and start looking for ways to rationalize your emotions, but if you truly understand that it's unnecessary to feel bad about your emotions or how you feel, it can be a huge relief. For many people, the biggest issue is beating themselves up over how they feel because they don't understand how emotions work. However, accepting your emotions can be a big step towards feeling better. By acknowledging that your emotional state is just an emotional cocktail that you don't fully understand, you can recognize that you are not flawed, unworthy, or a failure. Rather, it's just the emotional cocktail that's making you feel that way. The awareness that you have of yourself is not responsible for your emotional state, but it can help you understand it and course-correct it. This awareness can give you a sense of inner power as you realize that everything you experience, all the emotions and business in your life, are happening on a primitive level. The part of you that is aware has the ability to understand and course-correct it, which can be a significant relief. When you realize that everything in life has a scientific reason, it can be a relief to know that you can trust that everything makes sense. In order to tackle emotional issues, you need to be able to look at yourself as a third person. This requires working out, increasing your blood flow, and thinking more reasonably. Another crucial insight is the extent to which how you experience an emotion gets connected to a concept. Emotions and concepts go hand in hand in your brain and get connected to each other. As emotional beings, everything we think and do is driven by our emotions, even if we think we have all the awareness and insights. It's essential to understand that concepts are connected to emotions, and your emotions are what drive all your thinking on a subconscious level. When people think, they often use their emotions rather than abstract concepts. Therefore, it's crucial to detach concepts from emotions. In conversations, people may think they're talking about the same thing, but they're talking about their emotions. We may have the same concept and even agree with each other, but the emotions behind the concept can cause conflicts. Finally, your ability to understand and process information depends on your emotional state. If something triggers you, it can be challenging to process information clearly. Therefore, it's essential to recognize and acknowledge your emotional state to be able to process information accurately.

I know and you just discard everything I said because I trigger the emotion connected to spirituality and spirituality has a very positive connotation to you maybe because of a loss and spirituality has allowed you to cope with it, so it's very strong. But what is more important is understanding this relationship and looking at concepts from an abstract level and trying to detach yourself from the emotions. That's why whenever I also talk about it, what is very important to grow as a person is your ability to detach yourself from beliefs on an emotional level because that allows you to just go through life. And when you experience something and you see like a belief is flawed, you can just discard it and replace it with a stronger one. But if you go through life and you have a very strong emotion connected to that belief and you are confronted with that belief being flawed, you will, since on a subconscious level that is what drives you and makes you even think and drive your desire, you can just immediately feel like no, I can't let it go. You just can't let go the concepts, it's the problem that it's connected to an emotion. And being able to be aware of this mechanism, if you look at it at this process from a third-person, you can actually detach the emotion from the concept because the way it works, what you learn in neuroscience is memory consolidation, whenever you experience an emotion, you load it, and then it becomes basically label you experience the emotion, and then you write back the emotion. So, you will never experience an emotion the same, maybe they might experience similar, but you will never experience the emotion same. There's what they do in therapy, there are different strategies and different tricks to do it, but they load the emotion, and sometimes you can go into a catharsis or whatever, and the emotion can be relieved. And that way, let's say you have had a traumatic experience when you then think about the experience, the emotion doesn't get triggered as hard because it's more relieved. And understanding these mechanisms using your more advanced parts of the brain allows you to control your direction, your direction of your subconsciousness, which can give you a lot of strength and a lot of insight and a lot of growth. The reason why I'm explaining all this is to make you understand and realize that as hard it is to understand the world, as hard it is to make sense of anything you experience in your world, as hard it is to look around the world and go like why are things happening the way they are, as hard it is to make sense of things, everything has a reason. For a lot of people back in the days, thousands years ago, they were like God, and that was their explanation, that was their ability to explain their fear, and that what gives them a sense of peace, it gave them a sense of relief because they knew on a certain level they could trust God. The beauty about science and beauty about our knowledge about the brain and such now we can have that same trust in that everything happens for a reason on a scientific level, and that we have the ability to understand it. And I'm not gonna say like oh we can be our own God or something because some people might get really triggered by that, but in a sense, you have actual control and the ability to rewire yourself, and the only thing you lack is knowledge and understanding. But you do know on a fundamental level that everything does make sense, and the only thing that is between that and your ability to do something about it is understanding what is going on.

I want to explain to you the importance of understanding that you can control and overcome the things that are holding you back. Everything I've explained so far is crucial information to help you understand that, no matter how you feel or how you see things, everything makes sense, and you just need to understand it to overcome it. It's essential to know that it's not your fault, and it's not the aware part of your brain that's responsible. It's your subconscious, which is where your emotions and desires come from. However, your aware part is what can do something about it. Realizing this can give you a sense of power and empowerment. It may be challenging to understand this if you feel worthless due to social conditioning or if you're struggling to fit in. But, by taking care of your physical health and putting yourself in a position where the advanced parts of your brain have more neural activity, you can begin to comprehend these processes. This understanding is fundamental to overcoming what's holding you back.

This insight involves understanding the subconscious cocktail that drives you as you grow up and experience life. Every person acquires, on a subconscious level, what they find most important and valuable. It can be family, money, relationships, or something else entirely. This emotional cocktail values something based on your experiences, and it happens very impulsively. The reason why you adapt to these emotions and values is that, on a subconscious level, you feel the safest, and it allows you to tackle fear easily. It's a very primitive reason.

If you reflect on what you value the most in life on a subconscious level, you'll find that everybody has it. However, sometimes, even though you find these values essential, they're not always in line with your rational part or your experiences. This can cause dissonance and inner conflict, which can lead to a paradigm shift. You may start looking at things differently and adopt another core value subconsciously. This process happens automatically as you go through life.

The insight that can change your life quickly is to make the subconsciousness of making sense its main priority, its main core value on a subconscious level. By trusting that everything on a fundamental level is making sense, you can let go of your fears and anxieties and focus on understanding it.

If you make making sense your core value, rather than money, relationships, or family, you will be able to achieve anything you want more easily. Any value you already have will be more fulfilled, and you will have the ability to rise above any conflicts you have experienced in your life. This will turn all the dissonance into a drive to understand and cope with these feelings and conflicts in a way that will turn your life upside down and make you grow like crazy.

The only difference between me and you is that my core value, on a subconscious level, is to make sense. I desire to make sense of everything, so the moment I wake up and something I don't understand because I have conflict, the first thing that happens subconsciously is to try and make sense of it.

Aligning your beliefs with reality is logical and compatible with reality because nature has done that for millions of years. Making sense will allow you to be more able and compatible with reality because by making sense, you align your belief system with what reality is. If people fully understand this, it could potentially cause a psychological revolution where people start making sense, course-correcting their actions and their ideas, and, as a result, it ripples through the world, starting to make sense. If the world starts making more sense, there will be less war, poverty, and pain. This insight is fundamental. If you have anxieties and fears and don't know what to do in your life, understanding this will solve it all. For example, the reason why you procrastinate is because of your core value. If your core value is making sense, you wouldn't even be able to procrastinate anymore because it doesn't make sense. You will desire to take action instead.

Adopting making sense as a core value can have a ripple effect on yourself and the world. It's a simple idea, but it can bring a lot of insights and benefits.

> If people fully understand what I just explained not only will it change you for the better and will it allow you to achieve anything you want but it could also potentially cause a psychological revolution where people start making sense.
